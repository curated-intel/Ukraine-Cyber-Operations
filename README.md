  - #### Miscellaneous Resources
  - #### Equinix Threat Analysis Center (ETAC) contributions:
    - Contextualized [Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/tree/main/ETAC_IOCs) by ETAC `(Last updated 25 March 2022)`
    - Contextualized CERT-UA IOCs - see [here](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/blob/main/ETAC_IOCs/CERT-UA_IOCs.csv) `(Last updated 28 March 2022)`
    - Vetted [YARA rule collection](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/tree/main/yara) by ETAC `(Last updated 4 April 2022)`
    - Graphic of a Timeline of Russia-Ukraine Cyberwar `(Last updated 14 March 2022`)
    - Graphic of a Map of Russia-Ukraine Cyberwar `(Last updated 3 March 2022 `)
  - #### KPMG-Egyde Contributions: 
    - Added loosely-vetted [IOC Threat Hunt Feeds](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/tree/main/KPMG-Egyde_Ukraine-Crisis_Feeds/MISP-CSV_MediumConfidence_Filtered) (h/t [0xDISREL](https://twitter.com/0xDISREL)) `(Last updated 7 April 2022)`
    - IOCs shared by these feeds are `LOW-TO-MEDIUM CONFIDENCE` we strongly recommend NOT adding them to a blocklist
    - These could potentially be used for `THREAT HUNTING` and could be added to a `WATCHLIST`
    - IOCs are generated in `MISP COMPATIBLE` CSV format
    - Additional [Threat Hunt Feed](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/blob/main/KPMG-Egyde_Ukraine-Crisis_Feeds/MISP-CSV_LowConfidence_Unfiltered/Ukraine-Crisis_DomainTools_ThreatHunt_Feed.csv) for recently registered Ukrainian domain names (h/t DomainTools)
    - Additional [Threat Hunt Feed](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/blob/main/KPMG-Egyde_Ukraine-Crisis_Feeds/MISP-CSV_MediumConfidence_Filtered/Ukraine-Crisis_RecordedFuture_ThreatHunt_Feed.csv) for threat groups targeting Ukraine (h/t RecordedFuture)
    - Ukrainain organizations offered by [Access and Data Brokers](https://github.com/curated-intel/Ukraine-Cyber-Operations/blob/main/access_data_brokers.md) on underground forums
